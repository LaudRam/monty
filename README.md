##  Monty
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
## Compilation
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
```
## Usage
```
./monty file
```
- Where `file` is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
